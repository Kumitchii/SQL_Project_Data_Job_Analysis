# Introduction
Welcome to my SQL Portfolio Project, where I delve into the data job market with a focus on data analyst roles. This project is a personal exploration into identifying the top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and the intersection of high demand with high salary in the field of data analytics. The database available to me did not contain sufficient data from Ukraine, so the study is more general and does not focus exclusively on our labor market.

Check out my SQL queries here: [Project_sql folder](/SQL_Project_Data_Job_Analysis/sql_course/Project_sql/).

# Background

The motivation behind this project was to showcase my SQL skills using this database as a practical example. By analyzing the data analyst job market, I aimed to identify the most in-demand and highest-paying skills, making my job search more focused and strategic.

The data for this analysis is from Luke Barousse’s SQL Course (https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql). This data includes details on job titles, salaries, locations, and required skills. 

## The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn for a data analyst looking to maximize job market value?

# Tools I Used

In this project, I utilized a variety of tools to conduct my analysis:

- **SQL** (Structured Query Language): Enabled me to interact with the database, extract insights, and answer my key questions through queries.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the database management system, PostgreSQL allowed me to store, query, and manipulate the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** This open-source administration and development platform helped me manage the database and execute SQL queries.

# The Analysis

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here’s how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs

To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;

```

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs

To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;

/* Key Takeaways:

- SQL, Python, Tableau, and R are the essential baseline for most high-paying roles.

- Cloud platforms (Azure, AWS), big data (Pyspark, Databricks, Hadoop), and visualization (Power BI, PowerPoint) appear in roles with the highest salaries.

- Skills like Jupyter and PowerPoint, while often seen as supportive tools, are tied to top executive-level roles—possibly due to their use in presenting insights to stakeholders.

*/
```

### 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts

This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
GROUP BY 
    skills
ORDER BY 
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 4. Skills Based on Salary

Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS average_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
    skills
ORDER BY 
    average_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

### 5. Most Optimal Skills to Learn

Combining insights from demand and salary data, this query aimed to pinpoint skills that are both in high demand and have high salaries, offering a strategic focus for skill development.

```sql
WITH skills_demand AS (
    SELECT 
        skills_dim.skill_id,
        skills_dim.skills,
        COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
    FROM job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        skills_dim.skill_id
), average_salary AS (
    SELECT 
        skills_job_dim.skill_id,
        ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS average_salary
    FROM job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        skills_job_dim.skill_id
)

SELECT
    skills_demand.skill_id,
    skills_demand.skills,
    demand_count,
    average_salary
FROM
    skills_demand
INNER JOIN average_salary ON skills_demand.skill_id = average_salary.skill_id
ORDER BY 
    demand_count DESC, 
    average_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

Each query not only served to answer a specific question but also to improve my understanding of SQL and database analysis. Through this project, I learned to leverage SQL's powerful data manipulation capabilities to derive meaningful insights from complex datasets.

# What I Learned

Throughout this project, I honed several key SQL techniques and skills:

- **Complex Query Construction**: Learning to build advanced SQL queries that combine multiple tables and employ functions like **`WITH`** clauses for temporary tables.
- **Data Aggregation**: Utilizing **`GROUP BY`** and aggregate functions like **`COUNT()`** and **`AVG()`** to summarize data effectively.
- **Analytical Thinking**: Developing the ability to translate real-world questions into actionable SQL queries that got insightful answers.
